# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

Mastering Front-End Development with React.js, JSX, and Tailwind CSS

**📄 Project Overview**

This project is designed to demonstrate mastery of front-end development skills using React.js, JSX, and Tailwind CSS. 

The application is a responsive task manager that showcases component architecture, state management, hooks usage, and API integration.
**

**State Management: **

The TaskManager component allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks, with features like filtering and theme management using React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext).

**API Integration: 
**
The application fetches data from a public API (JSONPlaceholder) and displays it in a list layout, with features like loading and error handling, pagination, and search functionality.
